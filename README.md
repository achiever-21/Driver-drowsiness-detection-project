# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

![Demo](demo.gif)

## Overview

The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is an innovative solution designed to enhance road safety by detecting signs of driver fatigue and alertness impairment in real-time. Leveraging machine learning and neural network techniques, this system analyzes various driver behaviors and physiological signals to accurately identify drowsiness and prompt timely interventions.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection:** Constant monitoring of driver behavior to detect drowsiness as soon as it occurs.
- **Multi-modal Input:** Integration of multiple data sources including video feeds, steering wheel movements, and physiological signals for comprehensive analysis.
- **Adaptive Learning:** Continuously improving performance through adaptive learning techniques, incorporating feedback from user interactions and environmental changes.
- **Alert Mechanisms:** Prompting the driver through auditory, visual, or haptic feedback to regain alertness, preventing potential accidents.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive dashboard interface for easy setup, calibration, and monitoring of system performance.
